
My name is Clay Christensen. I design websites and write code in different languages.
I’ve lived all over the United States, but I currently live in Seattle Washington. 
I am attending Seattle Central College for an Associates Degree in computer programming.
I’ve been a computer geek my entire life and I finally get to make a career out of my life’s greatest passion.
I have experience in HTML5 and CSS3 and a little experience in other languages like Python and C++.
I have built several computers myself and for others and have consulted many clients on hardware specifications. 
Let's build something together.
